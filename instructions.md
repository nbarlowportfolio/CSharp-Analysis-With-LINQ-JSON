# MercuryWorks - Coding Screen



You are working with a large Fortune 500 client on their Advanced Proprietary Pizza Logistics Engine (APPLE).



The client has collected a dataset Data.json on its 2000 employees and wants to figure out a few VERY IMPORTANT statistics.



Requirements: Write an .NET Core 6 console application using C# that outputs the following data points:



- Which department has the largest number of employees who like Pineapple on their pizzas?



- Which department prefers Peperoni and Onions?



- How many people prefer Anchovies?



- How many pizzas would you need to order to feed the Engineering department, assuming a pizza feeds 4 people? Ignore personal preferences.



- Which pizza topping combination is the most popular in each department and how many employees prefer it?



You can answer these questions in any order you wish. Please spend no more than 90 minutes on this challenge. If you do not complete all the tasks, please include a few sentences about your approach or things you would do differently, given more time.
